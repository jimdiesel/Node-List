If you need more features, you may want to look for another package.\n\n\nMETHODS\n=======\n\n### getText\n\n> `void getText(String url, true, Function callback, [Object scope])`\n\n> The signature above corresponds to asynchrnous usage. Method do not return the value and do not throws exception on error. \nInstead, the success/error flag and returned text will be passed to `callback` functions, which will be executed in optional `scope`\n\n> `String getText(String url)`\n\n> The signature above corresponds to synchronous usage. Method returns the fetched text and throws exception on error. \n\n> `void|String getText(Object params)`\n\n> The signature above combine both variants of usage. The parameters for the call are passed as object with the following keys:\n \n> - `url` - url to fetch text from\n \n> - `async` - `true` for asynchrnous mode, `false` for synchronous\n \n> - `callback` - the callback function. Will be called in asynchronous usage mode as callback(success, text)\n \n> - `scope` - optional scope for `callback`\n \n> - `headers` - object which key/value pairs will be used to initialize the headers of the request \n\n\nGETTING HELP\n============\n\nThis extension is supported via github issues tracker: <http://github.com/SamuraiJack/JooseX-SimpleRequest/issues>\n\nYou can also ask questions at IRC channel : [#joose](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=joose&prompt=1)\n \nOr the mailing list: <http://groups.google.com/group/joose-js>\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n========\n\nWeb page of this module: <http://github.com/SamuraiJack/JooseX-SimpleRequest/>\n\nGeneral documentation for Joose: <http://joose.github.com/Joose>\n\n\n\nAUTHORS\n=======\n\nMalte Ubl\n\nNickolay Platonov [nplatonov@cpan.org](mailto:nplatonov@cpan.org)\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\n=====================\n\nCopyright (c) 2009, Nickolay Platonov\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n* Neither the name of Nickolay Platonov nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. \n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
